#   ansible-vault encrypt group_vars/all/vault.yml     (asks for a new password)
#   git add group_vars/all/vault.yml && git commit && git push

# Nothing is printed. The file is created 0600 and never left unencrypted:
# the script refuses to run if one already exists. Fields it cannot find are
# left as "change-me": fill them in with `ansible-vault edit`.
