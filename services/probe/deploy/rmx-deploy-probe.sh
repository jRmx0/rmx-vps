# Deploy one image tag of rmx-backend-probe. Installed as
# /usr/local/sbin/rmx-deploy-probe (root:root 0755). See README §10 "Probe".
#
# Called by GitHub Actions over SSH as the user "deploy". That user's
# authorized_keys entry forces this command, and sudoers lets it run this
# script as root, with this one argument shape, and nothing else:
#   ssh deploy@45.81.252.43 sha-1234abc
# By hand (as rmx): sudo rmx-deploy-probe sha-1234abc
#
# Steps: validate the tag -> pull -> rewrite PROBE_TAG in probe/.env ->
# if the probe is running, recreate probe-app and wait for "healthy";
# if it isn't healthy in time, put the previous tag back and fail.
# If the probe is off (profile stopped), only record and pull the tag:
# a deploy never turns the probe on.
