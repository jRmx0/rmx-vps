# Copy Caddy's Let's Encrypt certificate for mqtt.rmx.lt to Mosquitto.
#
# Caddy obtains and renews the cert (site block in services/caddy/Caddyfile)
# and keeps it root-only in its data folder. Mosquitto runs as uid 1883 and
# can't read that folder, so this script copies the cert and key into
# services/mosquitto/data/certs/ with owner 1883. When they changed, it sends
# SIGHUP to Mosquitto, which reloads them without dropping connections.
#
# Installed as /usr/local/sbin/rmx-mqtt-cert-sync, run as root by
# rmx-mqtt-cert-sync.timer. Safe to run by hand at any time.
